# Twenty-One-Card-Game
.NET Framework console application of the card game Twenty One (also known as Black Jack), created with visual C#.

I created a console application in Visual Studio, using C#, to simulate a game of Twenty-One. When the application is spun up, the player is prompted to give their name and amount of virtual money they are going to bring to the fictional casino. It goes on to ask the player for their bet and then simulates the dealing of cards and asks for a hit or check (as long as they haven't busted). The program then keeps track of money gained or lost as the player goes from round to round.
